Build a simple e-commerce cart flow with products listing page,
details page and cart page. It should be built using React.js for the
frontend and Node.js for the backend. The cart functionality should
work using redux. The backend can be built using Strapi.js and it'll
contain the list of products and orders placed by users. The
communication between the frontend and backend should happen through
GraphQL or REST API.

Working Flow:

1. Home page with list of products, and a feature to add those products to cart.
2. No of items added from the home page should reflect on the cart page.

Technology to be used:

1. Setup the project using Docker compose.
2. The backend will be built using Node.js
3. The frontend will be built using React.js
4. Connect backend and frontend using GraphQL or REST API
